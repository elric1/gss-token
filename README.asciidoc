GSS-TOKEN
=========

gss-token is simple program that generates and consumes BASE64 encoded
GSS tokens.  It comes in handy when testing as you can cut and paste
the tokens between terminal windows to test the Kerberos rather than
having to have a client/server (like knc(1)) program to do it.  It's
especially helpful when you have firewalls to configure to let extra
ports through.

HTTP SPNEGO authentication also uses base64 tokens and gss-token
supports add that text on with the -N flag:

......................................................................
	$ curl -H "Authorization: $(gss-token -N HTTP@server)" \
	> https://server/path/to/file
......................................................................

will opportunistically send a GSSAPI authentication with your HTTP
request.
